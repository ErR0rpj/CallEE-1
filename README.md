## Introduction:

  <h> Problems </h>
  
  "Unguided freshers lead to wrong direction"
   1) No platform exist where freshers or undergraduate can interact with seniors, alumni, professors of respective institute. College being conducted virtually these days, such       a platform is dire need of the new students, so that they can find mentors for themselves and set-up their future goals. 
   2) A Quizzing platform to prevent or reduce cheating unlike other various platforms is a dire need of professors and quizzing communities.

  <h> Proposed Solution </h>
  
   Problem 1 Solution: 
   
   1)The main objective of our hack was to build a bridge between juniors, seniors, alumni and professors of institute.
   
   2)Our platform will help them interact (using messaging and video calling) with each other or post queries in post section under various categories.
   
   
   Problem 2 Solution: 
   
   1)Our platform provides features to conduct quizzes with live leaderboard.
   
   2)Every question is once attemptable and can't be retrieved back after answering once. Hence the cheating is prevented.
   
   3)Quizzes can be conducted and attempted by students in various fields like academics, job oriented, etc.
